# SVN Book

The first version control tool I learned to use was CVS. Before that I had never heard of the concept "version control". Although I learned enough to use CVS, I didn't get a chance to fully understand how it works and why I needed to perform a step, possibly due to CVS's poor documentation.

Then I needed to learn how to use SVN because of work. The [SVN Book](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/) is a good example of how to help readers establish a good foundation of understanding the tool. Its [_Chapter 1. Fundamental Concepts_](https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.basic.html) explains the basic concepts very clearly and I got my epiphany after reading the chapter.
